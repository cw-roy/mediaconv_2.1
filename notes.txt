### Target

Batch convert video files to the .mp4 format. Focus on compatibility and file size reduction

### Tools

- FFmpeg
- Python 3.10

## Dev notes

### Setup

- [x] Create repo
- [x] Folder structure: input, output, and logging.
- [x] Platform Agnostic: Windows / *nix.

### Video Handling

#### File Prep

- [x] Filename Cleanup: Implement logic to handle spaces and non-alphanumeric characters.
- [x] File Validation: Check the validity of files in `convert_media`.

#### Pre-conversion Inspection

- [x] FFprobe: Capture pre-conversion file info
- [x] Inspection Logging: log pre-conversion details.

#### Conversion

- [x] Video Conversion: Fine tune FFMpeg command for efficiency & effectiveness
- [x] Output Naming: Ensure unique output file names.

#### Post-conversion Inspection

- [x] Post-conversion FFprobe: capture post-conversion file info (compare to pre-inspection)

### Future Plans

- [ ] Parallel Conversion: Explore options for parallel video conversion.
